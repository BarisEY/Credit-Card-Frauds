#Fraudulent Transaction Detection using Random Forest Classifier and Genetic Algorithm
This Jupyter notebook demonstrates how to use machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent transactions using a random forest classifier and a genetic algorithm for feature selection.

The dataset used in this notebook is obtained from XXX, which contains a large number of credit card transactions, with 30 unknown features and 3 known features. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with only a small percentage of transactions being fraudulent.

We will first preprocess the data by scaling and balancing the dataset. Then, we will use a genetic algorithm to select the most important features for the classification model. Finally, we will train a random forest classifier on the selected features and evaluate its performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

This notebook is suitable for data scientists and machine learning practitioners who want to learn how to use a random forest classifier with a genetic algorithm to detect fraudulent transactions in real-world datasets. The implementation details and code snippets are provided, along with the necessary explanations and visualizations.

Let's dive in!
